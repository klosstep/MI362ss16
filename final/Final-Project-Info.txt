***NOTE***
So I originally tried building my To-Do List web app on Heroku using the ClearDB add-on but I could not configure the settings properly in order to establish a database needed for the web app. 
I tried following the documentation provided by Heroku and ClearDB but it wasn't detailed enough for what I was trying to figure out.  
I also used Stack Exchange and other forums to try and set up the database but I still couldn't find enough documentation on those sites either.  
I learned some PHP/SQL this year and also learned how to set up a database with PHPMyAdmin so that's why my app is hosted on a different site from the landing page (the heroku page). Because I am more familiar in coding PHP and setting up databases in cPanel.  
Yes, I could have built a boring static site and hosted it on Heroku to get the 600 points, but I wanted to make something dynamic and thought this would be a more interesting, challenging, and relevant project.
